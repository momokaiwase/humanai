# AI Assistant

## Overview
AI Assistant is an AI chat bot that produces data visualization and data analysis. Based on an uploaded dataset and the user's questions into the chatbot, the AI returns data visualizations and analyses as appropriate. The software was developed to convey information about a dataset through aesthetic charts and simple analysis in order for users with a non-technical background to easily comprehend the data.

## Motivation
The development of AI Assistant was motivated by the desire to explore the use of AI. By integrating AI with a simple chat function and data, the AI Assistant is particularly suited for working with data, unlike a generic AI chatbot.
